## Some notes to the graph
1. What are your x- and y-axes?
> The x axis denotes the year and y axis denotes the deviations from the corresponding 1951-1980 means.  
2. Did you use a subset of the data? If so, what was it?  
> The subset I chose is the deviation of the global temperature, the temperature of the zone 24N - 90N, 24N - 24S and 90S - 24S  
3. Are there any particular aspects of your visualisation to which you would like to bring attention?  
> The rising tendency of the lines and the different fluctuations of each line drawn.
4. What do you think the data and your visualisation shows?  
> The graph shows primarily a rising tendency, both regionally and globally, implicating that the global warming is much more severe as time goes. And the graph also shows that, in the most cases, the temperature in the 24N - 90N is higher than the 90S - 24S ( I guess it's due to population and the development of the countries that lie within that region). And the region 24N - 24S fluctuates up and above the global average.  
So it seems that the countries within region 24N - 90N are the **main contributor** to global warming
